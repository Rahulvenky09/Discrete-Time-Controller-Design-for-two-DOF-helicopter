# Discrete-Time-Controller-Design-for-two-DOF-helicopter

We make use of two degree of freedom helicopter system due to its highly non-linear nature to design a 
discrete time controller for pitch and yaw channel with the help of root locus method. The 2DOF helicopter
system comprises of two identical propellers driven by DC motors where one propeller control the elevation 
of the helicopter (pitch angle) and other propeller is used to control the side to side motion (yaw angle) 
of the system. The root locus method helps in visualizing the poles and zeros as per system requirements
which results in the stability, controllability, and steady state error analysis of the proposed controller.
To ensure the validity of the proposed controller - Design specifications, Controller design, MATLAB (m-files)
and simulation are provided. This system has its applications in various fields such as military,
aerospace, industrial applications etc
